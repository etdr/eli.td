          I was interested in the NY Times' crossword webapp, which is also written in React, so I figured I would try my hand at it. Maybe the total lack of styling is due to all the work on this going into the actually-pretty-tricky algorithms to create the grids, move the cursor around the board, and light up various squares under certain conditions.

          This was a project I worked on with two fellow students at Eleven Fifty. The name is a Dutch term for alcohol (literally "fluid stuff", in the same way English uses "drink" with an alcoholic connotation sometimes).

          What I learned from this was that data scientists need to collaborate heavily with professionals from the fields to which they apply their data wizardry.

          This was the first anything I ever made in JS, back in 2017. I still don't know how I actually pulled it off. I see at the end of the page I commented some Stack Overflow pages but I'm positive that isn't all I must have looked up (could I have pulled that spread operator on line 176 out of a hat all by myself? no). As a result the code is an obvious mishmash of pre- and post-ES6 JavaScript but I am nonetheless really proud of figuring all this out and putting it together at that point in my life.
